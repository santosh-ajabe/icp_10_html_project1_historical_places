    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        This is Akola's oldest Shiva temple located inside Akola Fort is Rajeshwar Shiva Temple. <br>
        It was built by Chola Emperor Raj Rajeswar. While King Akolsingh was living in the Asadgad Fort, <br>
        there is a famous story associated with this temple. Every night his queen went to this temple to worship Shiva at midnight. <br>
        Once King Akolsingh thought that his queen was going out at midnight for illicit reasons, so he followed her with a sword; the queen came to know <br>
        that King Akolsingh was following her. She felt gloomy and guilty and went straight to the Shiva temple and pleaded to the god that her husband <br>
        the king was thinking wrong about her, and that it was insulting that he was having no faith in her loyalty and her character. So she pleaded to be allowed into Shiva's Pind. <br>
        The Shiva ling broke in two parts and the queen jumped in, and then it was closed. The king understood his mistake and could not forgive himself. <br>
        Still the Shiva ling in this temple has a little crack which is said to corroborate this story.    </p>

        <h3>History</h3><br>
        <p>
            Akola fort (also called Asadgad) along with the Narnala fort and Akot fort forms the major fortifications of the Akola <br>
            Prior to the construction of the fort by Asad Khan, at the same place was an earthen gadhi, village fort constructed by Akolsingh.</br>
             The fortress was built in 1697 by Asad Khan, during the reign of Aurangzeb by Asad Khan, from whom the fort took its name (Asadgad). <br>
             In 1803, Arthur Wellesley camped here before proceeding to win the Battle of Argaon in the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The fortress was dismantled by the British Raj in about 1870. <br>
              It was reported in 1910 in a district gazetteer that the central part of the fort was used as a school. Akola fort is notable in that it is bereft of any decorative embellishments. <br>
              There are several inscriptions on the fort. The fort in the old town situated on the western bank of the Morna has been repaired and constructed by the municipal council in 1957.<br>
               Some of the old bastions have also been repaired. The municipal council has laid out a beautiful park known as the Azad Park in the fort. <br>
            A big pillar has been created in of the fort in memory of the martyrs of the freedom movement. Havakhana still continues to be a monument, worth visiting.
