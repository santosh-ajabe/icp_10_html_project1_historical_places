<h1>History</h1>
<p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument completed in 1924 on the waterfront of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. He was the first British monarch to visit India.
The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture.
After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important government personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left in 1948, following Indian independence a year earlier. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions.</p>
<p>The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.
In March 2019, the Maharashtra State Government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the State Governor in February 2019.</p>
<p>The structure, in yellow basalt and concrete, is rectangular, with two long sides and two much shorter ones. Three arched passageways run between the long sides, as well as a single arched passageway between the two shorter sides. The central arch is higher and wider, with an extra storey above, from which four turrets rise. The arches on the short sides are the same size and design as the smaller arches on the long sides.</p>

<h1>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus</h1>
<img src="../img/places/csmt.jpg" height="250" width="400">
<br>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (officially Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus since 2017, formerly Victoria Terminus (VT), Bombay station code: CSMT (mainline)[5]/ST (suburban)), is a historic railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

    The terminus was designed by a British architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station,[7] and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule.
     Inside Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, 2022
    In March 1996, the station's name was officially changed from "Victoria Terminus" to "Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior king and the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire who founded the state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau.
     </p>
     <p>The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. </p>
     <p>The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Externally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. </p>

        <h1>Elephanta Cave</h1>
        <img src="../img/places/cave.jpg" height="250" width="400">
<br>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>The Elephanta Caves, located in Gharapuri, is situated at a distance of 11 km from the city of Mumbai. These Elephanta Caves are a UNESCO world heritage site. 
    The Elephanta Caves are a part of the busy City of Mumbai and a masterpiece in disguise. These caves are one of the major attractions in the whole city of Mumbai. Over the years, it has evolved into a tourist destination. The vintage historical significance of these Elephanta caves Mumbai draws tourists’ attention towards it.
    There are two groups of alcoves at the site of the Elephanta Caves Mumbai, the primary one is a large group of five Hindu caves and the second is a smaller group of two Buddhist caves. The Hindu caves include stone sculptures representing the Shaiva Hindu sect. 
    </p>
    <p>It is thought that the Elephanta Cave temple was constructed through Pandavas, but, some also credit the same to Banasura, the demon devotee of Shiva. Local convention dictates that the caves have been no longer built with the hands of men at all. 
        Historians date the Elephanta Cave temple lower returned to past due 5th – 8th century AD but excavations of Kshatrapa coins dated to the 4th century AD have additionally been unearthed right there. Records are available from the defeat of the Mauryan rulers of Konkan via the Badami Chalukyas emperor Pulakesi II. 
        
        At that point, Elephanta was referred to as Puri or Purika and turned into the capital of the Konkan Mauryas. As a result of this, a few historians believe that the caves were built using them during their reign. 
        
        Other historians have given credit for the caves to the Kalachuris who are believed to have some relationship with the Konkan Mauryas. These assumptions are primarily based on the truth that the Elephanta Caves history is devoted to Pashupata Shaivismsect, a sect to which Kalachuris, as well as Konkan Mauryas, belonged.

        <h1>Taj Hotel</h1>
        <img src="../img/places/tajmahal.jpg" height="250" width="400">
        <br>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>The Taj Mahal Palace is a heritage, five-star, luxury hotel in the Colaba area of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, situated next to the Gateway of India. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, it opened in 1903 as the Taj Mahal Hotel and has historically often been known simply as "The Taj". The hotel is named after the Taj Mahal, which is located in the city of Agra approximately 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) from Mumbai. It has been considered one of the finest hotels in the East since the time of the British Raj. The hotel was one of the main targets in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
Part of the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, the hotel has 560 or 600 rooms and 44 suites and is considered the flagship property of the group; it employs 1,600 staff. The hotel is made up of two different structures: the Taj Mahal Palace and the Tower, which are historically and architecturally distinct from each other (the Taj Mahal Palace was built in 1903; the Tower was opened in 1972).The Taj Mahal Hotel was commissioned by Jamsetji Tata and opened its doors to guests on 16 December 1903.
</p>
 <p>When it opened in 1903, the Taj Mahal Hotel was the first in India to have electricity, American fans, German elevators, Turkish baths and English butlers. Later, it also had the city's first licensed bar, India's first all-day restaurant, and India's first discotheque, Blow Up. Initially in 1903, it charged ₹13 for rooms with fans and attached bathrooms, and ₹20 with full board. During World War I, the hotel was converted into a military hospital with 600 beds.

    Between 1915 and 1919, work proceeded at Apollo Bundar, to reclaim the land behind the hotel where the Gateway of India was built in 1924. The Gateway of India soon became a major focal point in Bombay.
    
    Rattanbai Petit, wife of the founder of Pakistan, spent the last days of her life in a suite of the hotel, and eventually died there in 1929, at the age of 29. She was also the sister-in-law of one of the hostel's founder Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata's daughter, Sylla Tata.</p>

        <h1>Sanjay Gandhi National Park</h1>
        <img src="../img/places/nationalpark.jpg" height="250" width="400">
        <br>
<h1>History</h1> 
<p>The Kanheri caves, located centrally in the park, were important Buddhist learning centres and pilgrimage sites sculpted by Buddhist monks between the 9th and the 1st centuries BCE. They were chiselled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping. In 1996, the park was renamed to Sanjay Gandhi National Park, after Sanjay Gandhi. The same year, some forests from the Thane division were merged into the park, further expanding its total area to 103.84 km2 (40.09 sq mi).The park occupies most of the northern suburbs of Mumbai. To the west lie the suburbs of Goregaon, Malad, Kandivali, Borivali and Dahisar. To the east lie the suburbs of Bhandup and Mulund. To the south lies the Aarey Milk Colony and the university campus of IIT Bombay. The northern reaches of this forest lie in Thane city. The park and the areas surrounding it, except Thane city, are all part of Mumbai. It is the only protected forest located within the limits of a city.</p>
<p>This park is home to a number of endangered species of flora and fauna. The forest area of the park houses over 1,000 plant species, 251 species of migratory, land, and water birds, 5,000 species of insects, and 40 species of mammals. In addition, the park also provides shelter to 38 species of reptiles, 9 species of amphibians, 150 species of butterflies, and a large variety of fish.

    Flora
    
    Karvi flower (Strobilanthes callosus)
    In the state of Maharashtra, the mass flowering of karvi has been observed to occur in Mumbai in the same year as in the hill station of Khandala and one year earlier in Bhimashankar and Malshej Ghat, beyond Kalyan.The forest cover in the park helps provide the ideal habitat for many wild animals. Chital, rhesus macaque and bonnet macaque are some of the wild mammals often spotted inside the park. Other large mammals found in the park include black-naped or Indian hare, muntjac (barking deer), porcupine, Asian palm civet, Small Indian civet, chevrotain, grey langur, Indian flying fox, sambar deer and leopard.</p>

        <h1>Rajabai Clock Tower</h1>
        <img src="../img/places/clocktower.jpg" height="250" width="400">
<br>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>The Rajabai Clock Tower was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, an English architect. He modeled it on Big Ben in London. The foundation stone was laid on 1 March 1869 and construction was completed in November 1878. The total cost of construction came to ₹550,000, a large amount of money for the time period. A portion of the total cost of construction was donated by Premchand Roychand Jain, a wealthy broker who founded the Bombay Stock Exchange on the condition that the tower be named after his mother Rajabai.
Premchand Roychand's mother was blind and as a staunch follower of Jain religion, she was supposed to consume her dinner before the evening.  Legend says that the evening bell of the tower helped her to know the time without anyone's help.
The tower was closed to the public after it became a frequent spot for those attempting suicide.</p>
<p>The tower was built in a fusion of Venetian and Gothic styles. It is built out of the locally available buff coloured Kurla stone. The tower has one of the best stained glass windows in the city.[4]
Council Building of the University of Mumbai in India, around 1905
    The ground floor has two side rooms, each measuring 56 ft × 27.5 ft (17.1 m × 8.4 m). The tower forms a carriage porch 2.4 m2 (26 sq ft), and a spiral staircase vestibule of 2.6 m2 (28 sq ft). The Tower, over the carriage porch, has a square form up to the gallery at the top of the first level which is at a height of 68 feet (21 m) from the ground. The form changes from a square to an octagon and the height from this gallery to the top of the tower is 118 feet (36 m) and the third stage to the top of the finial is 94 feet (29 m), thus making a total height of 280 feet (85 m).
    During its time, it was the tallest structure in the city of Mumbai.</p>
