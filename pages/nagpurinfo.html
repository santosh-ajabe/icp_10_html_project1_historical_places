        Ramtek has got Historic temple of lord Rama. It is believed that Ramtek was the place where Rama, the Hindu god, rested while he was in exile. Legend has it that the aashram of great Hindu sage Agastya was situated close to Ramtek. While the sages performed religious rites, the demons used to disrupt their activities and slayed a great number of holy men. Lord Rama was distressed to hear about this, and took a vow to relieve the world from the demons. ‘Tek’ means vow in local language, hence the word Ramtek comes from ‘Vow of Ram’. Thus it is believed locally that whoever takes a vow at Ramtek is blessed by the gods for its fulfillment. The ‘padukas’ of Lord Ram are believed to have been worshipped here for centuries. The present temple is believed to have been built by the King of Nagpur Raghuji Bhonsale,after his victory over fort of Deogarh in Chindwara.

       Ramtek is also known for ancient Jain temple with various ancient statues of Jain Tirthankara. It became more popular when one of the top Digambar Jain Acharyas, Acharya Vidyasagar visited and stayed in Ramtek in 1993, 94 and 2008 for the four months of chaturmas during the rainy season. With his inspiration, a big Jain temple has been constructed.

    <h1> History</h1>
    <p> One of the stunning 1200 year old temple in Maharashtra (Nagpur) named as Karpur Baoli . Karpur means Camphor and Baoli means water tank. It is said that the Water in the well has camphor smell and was use as medication. It is an ancient Baoli few kilometers away from the temples at Ramtek and there is a dilapidated temple locally called as Kali Mata Temple stands on one end of the Karpur Baoli.</p>
      <p>  Karpur baoli is dedicated to 6 goddess namely Chamunda , Bhairavi , Ingalaj, Kali , Ranchandi and Kapurta .  It houses in the garbhagriha a fragmentary part of sculptural panel is placed inside.Constructed by the rulers of the Yadava dynasty between the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., this old baoli is dedicated to six goddesses and is a few km from the Ramtek temples. A ruined temple known locally as the Kali Mata Temple sits on one end of the Karpur Baoli.28 Dec 2023
    </p>
        <p>The temple is also provided with pillared corridors. This temple and baoli seem to be of later date and may be assigned 9th-10th century C.E. on the stylistic ground or Hemadpanti style. Locals claimed that the water level of the pond never goes down. It is a lesser explored place of Maharashtra. The combination of pond and hills behind the temple makes it look more scenetic.
        A traveller may spend many serene hours wandering around the temple complex, gazing at the magnificent architectural edifice and the carvings. Or may sit near the baoli .

       <h2> History </h2>
       <p> Swaminarayan Bhagwan , the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampraday, established temples, known as mandirs (Devnagari: मन्दिर), as part of his philosophy of theism and deity worship. These mandirs are known as Swaminarayan Hindu templess.</p>

        <p>He constructed nine temples in the following cities; Ahmedabad, Bhuj, Muli, Vadtal, Junagadh, Dholera, Dholka, Gadhpur & Jetalpur. In these temples he installed images of various Hindu gods, such as NarNarayan Dev, LaxmiNarayan Dev, RadhaKrishna Dev, RadhaRaman Dev, Revti-Baldevji, Madan Mohan Dev etc.[2] Each of these nine original temples fall either under the NarNarayan Dev Gadi, Ahmedabad or the LaxmiNarayan Dev Gadi, Vadtal depending on their geographical location.</p>
        
        <p>One of the most prominent features of the heritage of Swaminarayan Sampradaya is temple architecture. The images in the temples built by Swaminarayan Bhagwan are the evidence of the priority of Swaminarayan Bhagwan . All of the temples constructed during his life show some form of Krishna, and all temples since have such worshipable murtis. In Vadtaldham he as a god concentrated his own life form known as Harikrushna Maharaj. In the temples of the dioceses of Ahmedabad and Vadtal, they are predominantly a central altar or a shrine. Human forms are predominant but for a known exception of a Hanuman temple at Sarangpur, where Hanuman is the central figure.The temples have accommodations for sadhus built next to them. Stones were quarried in far places and carried to the temple sites.</p>
        
        <p>Swaminarayan temples, like other Hindu temples, have walkways around the central shrine to allow worshipers to circumambulate the shrine. These are often decorated with designs and inlaid marble. The main shrine area is divided by railings. One side of the railing is reserved for women, as Swaminarayan propagated that men and women should be separated in temples to allow full concentration on god. Men do a specified number of prostrations (as decided by themselves). In front of the men's section, there is a small section reserved for ascetics and special guests. There is great variety in form and nature of the central images, in front of which are gold- or silver-plated doors that open during darshan.</p>
        
        Today there are over a thousand Swaminarayan temples,spread across five continents, which come under the above two Gadis (seats) of the Swaminarayan Sampraday.
        
        <p>The Swaminarayan Temple, also known as the Akshardham Temple, is one of Nagpur's newest structures, located on the city's outer ring road. The temple, also known as Swaminarayan Temple, is well-equipped with amenities such as a parking lot, a large kitchen, a restaurant, and a children's play area. The Swaminarayan Temple Nagpur has two stories and is notable for its architecture. You should visit this temple after 4:00 p.m. because it is beautifully decorated in the evening and the sight is mesmerizing. The Swaminarayan Temple entry fee is free of cost.
